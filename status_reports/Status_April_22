Progress this week:
We added configuration for using User-based CF. We have added experiments for for running time for both user based and item based CF.
We have created and installed monetDB column store to our collection of main memory dbs with test data. 

Plans for next week:
We are planning to install and test RecDB with the test dataset and compare it with our DB installs. 
We are planning to add much bigger dataset to start getting results of comparison between monetdb, voltdb, recDB and postgres.
