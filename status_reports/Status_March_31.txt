Progress this week:
We worked setting up recommender system framework Lenskit. We worked on setting up H-store, but 
we run into problem with H-store documentation. It seem it does not cover basic inserts, selects.
I think the system is created to run predifined benchmarks. Now we are trying to work on industrial 
version of H-store VoltDB. We have also worked on creating connections plugins for Lenskit.
For now, we have setup small dataset in Postgres and will try to get it working. So far it is connecting and 
running basic item recommendation of postgres. 


Plans for next week:
We plan to design and run experiments. We will identify metrics that we will be using to evaluate 
in-memory databases with recommender system. We will work on finding alternative in-memory systems 
compatible with Lenskit. For now, we identified VoltDB.
