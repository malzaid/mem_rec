Progress this week:
We build Voltdb trial version on our local machine. We have added our small test dataset and 
created stored procedures that we will try to incorporate later. We have added database connection for VoltDB.
Lenskit now able to do recommendations based on VoltDB data. Started working on RecDB, based on recommendation from 
Dr. Sarwat. We are currently exploring how we can compare results form RecDB and our setup. 


Plans for next week:
We are planning to RecDB with Voltdb and regular Postgres on the same dataset. 
We are currently doing Item-based CF. We will start using both Item-based CF and User-based CF to compared 
results on VoltdB and postgres for now. 
We plan add an other database based on column-major structure. We also plan to start running experiments
on bigger dataset.
